Comprehensive Clinical Progress Note for Caitlin Dunn's Therapy Session on May 28, 2025

Caitlin presented to today's session reporting significant emotional distress following recent major life events, including her engagement and subsequent job loss. She stated, "I haven't slept since we got back because, like, I'm feeling a lot of emotions, and I don't know how to control them." She identified "Bailey" (likely a term for her anxious or critical inner voice) as being particularly active: "Bailey's really taking over my brain lately, and I, like, don't know how to turn her off."

Regarding her engagement on May 17, Caitlin described the day as initially "perfect," stating, "He surprised me. He did everything like the day was perfect. I had the best day. Like, everything went so smoothly." She appreciated the location ("on the beach where it's, like, our favorite spot") and the effort Kieran put into planning, including photos and a family party. However, she reported significant internal conflict and anxiety related to the engagement ring: "In today's world with freaking goddamn social media, a society and status in bullshit... everyone is getting like these, like... everyone judges you on how you get fucking engaged, what ring you get." She expressed self-doubt: "I think Bailey took over, and I was like, Is my ring pretty enough? Like, is it big enough?" She acknowledged the ring's sentimental value (containing her late father's diamond) but struggled with societal pressures and her own design preferences: "I'm a very particular person as a designer too, like I gave him instructions of what I wanted, and when I got the ring, it wasn't exactly I wanted."

Caitlin reported conflict with her fiancé, Kieran, when trying to discuss her questions about the ring's construction: "The way I tried to relate it to Kieran. He got so upset and like, call me a brat." She clarified her intention was simply to understand the jeweler's choices: "I just want to understand why X, Y and Z went when I wrote everything down and gave you, like examples." She eventually resolved her questions with the jeweler directly.

Following the engagement, Caitlin described feeling overwhelmed by external pressures related to wedding planning: "Now everyone's asking, When are we getting married? What's the budget? My mom's, like, frustrated that Karen's parents are not paying enough." This led to significant distress and conflict: "I had a breakdown, and Kieran and I had to take a freaking little piece of the Klonopin because I was like, this is not supposed to be like this. Like, it's supposed to be a happy thing."

Compounding this stress, Caitlin reported losing her job the day after getting engaged: "I literally get engaged, and then the next day I literally lose my job." She described the circumstances of the layoff, attributing it to her boss's financial mismanagement of another company: "The reason you're getting laid off is because I'm messing up in my other company... I have to step out of this job and focus on the trucking company because I'm stuck in money issues, and we can't afford your paycheck." She expressed relief at leaving the job ("I was relieved. I was like, I'm getting the fuck out") but also significant anxiety about unemployment and finances: "Now I don't have insurance in a month... now I have to be fucking cost efficient because I don't have a fucking job."

Caitlin reported significant conflict with her mother regarding the job loss and subsequent job search. She described her mother as intrusive and shaming: "My mom... thinks that I stay every day and probably do nothing... she's just gonna keep badgering at me until I get a fucking new job." She detailed her mother's interference, including contacting potential employers behind her back: "He went behind my back and was like, messaging people when I was on vacation... I don't think I got this babysitting gig because my mom was fucking messaging them." Caitlin expressed frustration and a desire to set boundaries: "How do I stop? Stop, stop it. So I'm not like in that issue."

Caitlin also reported experiencing a significant emotional event the morning of her engagement, which she interpreted as a sign from her late father: "My dad sent me a sign that morning... I woke up and I was like, I have to text my brother that dad is so happy in heaven right now... then I kept crying, because I was like, this is weird." This experience added to the emotional intensity of the day.

Objective

Caitlin presented to the session appearing visibly distressed and emotionally overwhelmed. Her speech was rapid at times, particularly when discussing recent stressors like her engagement, job loss, and conflicts with her mother. Her affect was predominantly anxious and frustrated, with moments of tearfulness when discussing her late father and the pressures surrounding her engagement.

Caitlin demonstrated significant cognitive preoccupation with external judgments, particularly regarding her engagement ring and societal expectations: "Everyone judges you on how you get fucking engaged, what ring you get... every girl is judging you." This preoccupation appeared to generate considerable anxiety and self-doubt, overriding her stated appreciation for the ring's sentimental value.

Her description of interactions with her mother revealed a pattern of enmeshment and difficulty with boundaries. Caitlin's affect became notably agitated and frustrated when discussing her mother's interference in her job search and wedding planning. She expressed a desire for autonomy but struggled with how to assert boundaries effectively.

Caitlin showed insight into the negative impact of external pressures on her relationship with Kieran: "I don't want this to, like, ruin everything." She reported resorting to Klonopin with Kieran to manage the stress, indicating the severity of the emotional overwhelm experienced.

When discussing her job loss, Caitlin's affect shifted between relief at leaving a difficult work situation and anxiety about unemployment and financial insecurity. Her description of her former boss suggested a history of manipulative behavior, aligning with previous discussions in therapy.

Caitlin engaged well with the therapist, seeking validation and guidance on managing her emotions and interpersonal conflicts. She responded thoughtfully to therapeutic interventions, particularly the discussion around setting boundaries with her mother. Her cognitive functioning appeared intact, though her emotional state was clearly dysregulated due to the accumulation of recent stressors.

Assessment

Caitlin presents with symptoms consistent with an Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood, triggered by a confluence of major life events: engagement, job loss, and ongoing conflict with her mother. Her inability to sleep and reported difficulty "controlling" her emotions indicate significant psychological distress and emotional dysregulation.

The engagement, while a positive event, has activated anxieties related to societal expectations, self-worth, and perfectionism, particularly evident in her preoccupation with the ring. This suggests underlying vulnerabilities related to external validation and comparison, possibly exacerbated by her background as a designer. Her internal conflict ("Bailey") appears to represent this critical, anxious voice.

The job loss, occurring immediately after the engagement, has created significant practical and emotional stress, including financial insecurity and loss of health insurance. This event has also reactivated problematic dynamics with her mother, who appears to respond to Caitlin's vulnerability with intrusive and shaming behaviors, further exacerbating Caitlin's distress.

Caitlin's relationship with her mother is characterized by enmeshment and poor boundaries. The mother's interference in Caitlin's job search (contacting potential employers) represents a significant boundary violation that undermines Caitlin's autonomy and potentially harms her prospects. Caitlin's difficulty asserting boundaries stems from this long-standing pattern and perhaps a fear of conflict or loss of connection.

Caitlin demonstrates strengths in her relationship with Kieran, describing it as generally stable ("We don't even fight"). However, the external pressures surrounding the engagement and job loss are clearly straining the relationship, necessitating coping strategies like shared Klonopin use. Her insight into the potential negative impact of these stressors on her relationship is a positive prognostic indicator.

Her interpretation of the experience on the morning of her engagement as a sign from her late father suggests ongoing processing of grief and a desire for connection with him, particularly during significant life transitions. This spiritual or intuitive dimension adds another layer to her emotional experience.

Overall, Caitlin is experiencing a period of acute stress due to multiple simultaneous life changes and interpersonal conflicts. Her primary challenges involve managing overwhelming anxiety, navigating external pressures related to engagement and wedding planning, establishing healthy boundaries with her mother, and coping with the practical and emotional consequences of unemployment.

Plan

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Skills: Focus on distress tolerance skills (e.g., TIPP, self-soothing, radical acceptance) to manage acute anxiety and emotional overwhelm. Introduce emotion regulation skills to help Caitlin identify, understand, and modulate her emotional responses rather than trying to "control" them. Mindfulness skills will also be beneficial for managing racing thoughts and preoccupation with external judgments.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Interventions: Target cognitive distortions related to external validation, perfectionism, and societal pressures surrounding the engagement and ring. Help Caitlin challenge and reframe thoughts contributing to anxiety and self-doubt (e.g., "Is my ring pretty enough?"). Explore core beliefs related to self-worth and external approval.

Boundary Setting Skills Training: Provide psychoeducation on boundaries (limits vs. boundaries vs. requests) and coach Caitlin on specific strategies for setting and maintaining boundaries with her mother. Role-play assertive communication techniques to increase her confidence in managing intrusive behaviors. Focus on protecting her peace and autonomy during the job search and wedding planning.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) Interventions: Help Caitlin clarify her values related to her relationship with Kieran, her career, and her well-being. Use ACT principles to encourage acceptance of difficult emotions and external circumstances (like job loss) while committing to actions aligned with her values (e.g., focusing on the meaning of her relationship rather than external wedding pressures).

Grief Processing: Gently explore the significance of the perceived sign from her father and allow space for ongoing grief processing, particularly how his absence is felt during major life events like engagement.

Stress Management Techniques: Reinforce basic stress management strategies, including sleep hygiene (given her reported insomnia), relaxation techniques, and engaging in enjoyable activities to counterbalance stress.

Relationship Support: Support Caitlin and Kieran in navigating the external pressures on their relationship. Encourage open communication between them about the impact of stress and reinforce their partnership as a source of mutual support.

Career Counseling: While therapy focuses on emotional well-being, validate the stress of the job search and support Caitlin in accessing practical resources if needed. Normalize the time it takes to find suitable employment and challenge maternal pressure for immediate results.

Follow-up: Schedule next session to monitor anxiety levels, progress with boundary setting, and coping with unemployment stress. Continue skills training and cognitive restructuring work. Assess need for medication consultation if anxiety remains unmanageable despite therapeutic interventions.

Supplemental Analyses

Tonal Analysis

Shift 1: From Joyful Description to Anxious Preoccupation:

Caitlin initially described her engagement day with a tone of genuine joy and appreciation: "He surprised me... the day was perfect... everything went so smoothly." Her tone conveyed happiness and satisfaction with Kieran's efforts. However, this shifted dramatically to an anxious, preoccupied tone when discussing the engagement ring and societal pressures: "In today's world with freaking goddamn social media... everyone judges you... Is my ring pretty enough? Like, is it big enough?" The tone became rapid, worried, and self-doubting, revealing how external comparisons and perceived judgments overshadowed her personal experience and the sentimental value of the ring. This shift highlights the powerful influence of social comparison and external validation on Caitlin's internal state, turning a positive event into a source of significant anxiety.

Shift 2: From Assertive Clarification to Hurt Frustration:

When recounting her conflict with Kieran about the ring, Caitlin initially adopted an assertive, clarifying tone: "I just want to understand why X, Y and Z went when I wrote everything down." She emphasized her need for information as a designer. This shifted to a tone of hurt frustration when describing Kieran's reaction: "He got so upset and like, call me a brat." The shift reflects her feeling misunderstood and unfairly characterized, highlighting the difficulty in communicating her needs within the relationship when under stress.

Shift 3: From Overwhelmed Distress to Resigned Acceptance (re: Wedding Pressure):

Discussing the pressures of wedding planning, Caitlin's tone was initially one of overwhelmed distress: "Now everyone's asking... My mom's, like, frustrated... I had a breakdown... this is not supposed to be like this." Her voice conveyed anxiety and a sense of losing control over what should be a happy process. After the therapist validated her experience and emphasized focusing on her and Kieran's intentions, her tone shifted slightly towards resigned acceptance, acknowledging the external noise but potentially refocusing on the core relationship, although the overwhelm remained palpable.

Shift 4: From Relief to Anxiety (re: Job Loss):

When discussing losing her job, Caitlin's tone initially conveyed relief: "I was relieved. I was like, I'm getting the fuck out." This reflected her dissatisfaction with the previous work environment. However, this quickly shifted to an anxious, worried tone when considering the consequences: "Now I don't have insurance in a month... now I have to be fucking cost efficient because I don't have a fucking job." This rapid shift illustrates the conflicting emotions associated with the job loss – freedom from a negative situation coupled with significant fear about practical insecurities.

Shift 5: From Agitated Frustration to Seeking Guidance (re: Mother):

Caitlin's tone became highly agitated and frustrated when describing her mother's intrusive behavior: "She's just gonna keep badgering at me... He went behind my back and was like, messaging people." Her speech quickened, and her voice conveyed anger and helplessness. This intense frustration shifted to a more seeking, questioning tone when asking the therapist for help: "So how do I stop? Stop, stop it. So I'm not like in that issue?" This shift indicates a recognition of the problematic dynamic and a genuine desire for tools to change it, moving from reactive anger to proactive problem-solving.

Shift 6: From Mystical Wonder to Tearful Grief (re: Father's Sign):

Recounting the experience she interpreted as a sign from her late father, Caitlin's tone initially held a quality of mystical wonder and confusion: "My dad sent me a sign that morning... I woke up and I was like, What the fuck like, I never, like, get a sign." This shifted to tearful grief as she processed the emotional impact: "Then I kept crying, because I was like, this is weird. He's he's gone." This tonal shift reveals the complex interplay of spiritual or intuitive experience with the raw emotion of grief, particularly poignant during a major life milestone like engagement.

Thematic Analysis

Theme 1: External Validation vs. Internal Experience:

A dominant theme was the conflict between Caitlin's internal experience and her preoccupation with external validation and societal pressures. This was most evident in her reaction to the engagement ring. Despite its sentimental value (her father's diamond) and Kieran's thoughtful planning, her focus shifted to external judgments: "Everyone judges you... Is my ring pretty enough? Is it big enough?" This theme reflects a struggle to trust her own feelings and values amidst perceived societal expectations, particularly amplified by social media. Her identity as a designer also contributes, creating internal standards that clash with external realities. This conflict generates significant anxiety and undermines her ability to fully enjoy positive life events.

Theme 2: Enmeshment and Boundary Difficulties with Mother:

The problematic dynamic with her mother emerged as a major theme and source of acute stress. The mother's intrusive behaviors (contacting potential employers, constant questioning, shaming) demonstrate significant enmeshment and a lack of respect for Caitlin's autonomy. Caitlin's description reveals a long-standing pattern: "She babies me... You guys have had this enmeshed relationship for forever." Caitlin's intense frustration and feeling of helplessness ("How do I stop? Stop, stop it?") highlight her difficulty in establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries. The mother's actions appear rooted in her own anxieties and need for control, but they actively undermine Caitlin's independence and well-being, particularly during a vulnerable period of job loss.

Theme 3: Coping with Multiple Simultaneous Stressors:

Caitlin is navigating a period of intense, overlapping stressors: engagement (positive but stressful), job loss (negative), financial insecurity, health insurance concerns, wedding planning pressures, and conflict with her mother. The sheer volume and timing of these events contribute to her feeling overwhelmed and unable to sleep. Her statement, "We literally get engaged and we can't really enjoy it, because shit just happens in life," encapsulates this theme. The session highlighted her struggle to cope with this accumulation of stress, leading to emotional dysregulation and reliance on coping mechanisms like Klonopin. This theme underscores the need for robust stress management and distress tolerance skills.

Theme 4: Grief and Connection with Deceased Father:

The presence of Caitlin's late father was a subtle but significant theme. His diamond is central to the engagement ring, imbuing it with deep personal meaning that conflicts with external pressures. The perceived sign on the morning of the engagement ("Dad is so happy in heaven") brought his memory and her grief to the forefront during a pivotal moment. Furthermore, Caitlin explicitly noted his absence in managing her mother: "I don't have my dad here anymore. My dad always put her in her place... He's not here now. So I have to learn." This theme highlights the ongoing impact of her father's death, the ways she seeks connection with him, and how his absence affects current family dynamics and her coping resources.

Theme 5: Relationship Strain Under Pressure:

While Caitlin described her relationship with Kieran as fundamentally strong, the external stressors are clearly causing strain. Conflict arose over the ring discussion ("He got so upset and like, call me a brat"), and the overwhelming pressure led them to take Klonopin together. Caitlin's worry ("I don't want this to, like, ruin everything") reflects her awareness of the potential damage external factors can inflict on the relationship. This theme emphasizes the importance of communication, mutual support, and protecting the relationship dyad from external interference (particularly from her mother and societal wedding pressures).

Sentiment Analysis

Sentiments About Self

Caitlin expressed predominantly negative sentiments about her current state and her ability to cope:

Overwhelmed/Anxious: This was the most frequent sentiment, reflected in statements like "I'm feeling a lot of emotions, and I don't know how to control them," "I haven't slept," and descriptions of having a "breakdown." The sentiment was one of being overcome by stress and unable to manage her internal state.Self-Doubt/Insecurity: Particularly regarding the ring and external judgments, Caitlin expressed significant self-doubt: "Is my ring pretty enough? Is it big enough?" and questioning her decisions. This negative sentiment reflects vulnerability to external validation and a lack of confidence in her own choices.Frustration/Helplessness: Especially concerning her mother's actions, Caitlin conveyed intense frustration and a sense of helplessness: "How do I stop? Stop, stop it?" This sentiment highlights her feeling trapped in a negative dynamic she doesn't know how to change.

Sentiments About Others/External Situations

Sentiments towards others were mixed, often negative regarding external pressures and her mother, but positive towards Kieran and her late father:

Negative Judgment of Societal Pressures: Caitlin expressed strong negative sentiment towards social media and societal expectations around engagements: "Freaking goddamn social media, a society and status in bullshit... everyone judges you." This reflects anger and frustration at external forces impacting her personal experience.Ambivalence/Frustration towards Mother: Sentiments towards her mother were overwhelmingly negative and frustrated due to her intrusive and shaming behavior. Phrases like "badgering," "went behind my back," and the therapist's identification of "shame" capture this negative sentiment.Positive/Appreciative towards Kieran (mostly): Despite conflict over the ring, Caitlin's underlying sentiment towards Kieran seemed positive, appreciating his effort in the proposal and viewing their relationship as fundamentally sound. However, stress was clearly impacting this, leading to shared anxiety.Positive/Connected towards Father: Sentiments related to her late father were positive, involving connection and seeking his approval ("Dad is so happy in heaven"), albeit tinged with grief.Negative towards Former Boss/Job: While relieved to be out, her description of her boss's behavior conveyed negative sentiment regarding his manipulation and the stressful work environment.

Sentiments About Therapy/Therapeutic Process

Caitlin's sentiments towards therapy were generally positive and seeking:

Seeking Guidance/Support: She actively sought advice and validation from the therapist, particularly regarding boundary setting with her mother ("How do I stop?"). This reflects a positive view of therapy as a resource.Openness/Receptivity: Caitlin appeared receptive to the therapist's interpretations and suggestions, such as the explanation of her mother's shaming behavior and the importance of boundaries. This positive sentiment suggests motivation for change.

The overall sentiment ratio was heavily weighted towards negative emotions (anxiety, frustration, overwhelm, self-doubt) due to the convergence of multiple stressors. Positive sentiments were primarily linked to the core relationship with Kieran and connection with her father, highlighting these as potential sources of resilience.

Key Points

• Acute Stress from Multiple Life Changes: Caitlin is experiencing significant emotional dysregulation due to the simultaneous impact of major positive (engagement) and negative (job loss) life events, compounded by external pressures and interpersonal conflict. Her inability to sleep and feeling overwhelmed highlight the severity of the stress response. Prioritizing distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and stress management skills is crucial for immediate stabilization.

• Enmeshment with Mother as Primary Stressor: The intrusive and shaming behavior of Caitlin's mother is a major contributing factor to her current distress, undermining her autonomy and exacerbating anxiety related to job loss and wedding planning. Assisting Caitlin in establishing and maintaining firm boundaries with her mother is a key therapeutic goal to protect her well-being and her relationship with Kieran.

• Vulnerability to External Validation: Caitlin's preoccupation with societal judgments regarding her engagement ring reveals an underlying vulnerability to external validation and social comparison, which significantly detracts from her ability to enjoy positive experiences. Addressing the cognitive distortions and core beliefs related to self-worth and external approval is necessary to build internal resilience against these pressures.

Significant Quotes

"I haven't slept since we got back because, like, I'm feeling a lot of emotions, and I don't know how to control them. Bailey's really taking over my brain lately, and I, like, don't know how to turn her off."

Caitlin stated this early in the session, encapsulating her primary presenting problem: overwhelming emotional distress and a sense of losing control over her internal state. The mention of "Bailey" (her anxious/critical inner voice) highlights the internal cognitive component of her anxiety. This quote is significant because it sets the stage for the session, indicating severe emotional dysregulation triggered by recent events and revealing her struggle with managing intense emotions. It underscores the need for skills in distress tolerance and emotion regulation.

"In today's world with freaking goddamn social media, a society and status in bullshit... everyone is getting like these, like... everyone judges you on how you get fucking engaged, what ring you get like... I think Bailey took over, and I was like, Is my ring pretty enough? Like, is it big enough?"

This quote reveals the powerful impact of perceived societal pressures and external validation on Caitlin's experience of her engagement. It's significant because it illustrates how external comparisons can overshadow personal meaning and joy, turning a positive event into a source of intense anxiety and self-doubt. It highlights a core vulnerability related to social comparison and external approval, linking it directly to her internal critical voice ("Bailey"). This points to the need for cognitive restructuring around self-worth and external validation.

"He went behind my back and was like, messaging people when I was on vacation... I don't think I got this babysitting gig because my mom was fucking messaging them... How do I stop? Stop, stop it. So I'm not like in that issue?"

This quote details the extreme nature of her mother's intrusive behavior and Caitlin's resulting frustration and helplessness. It's significant because it exemplifies the severe boundary violations occurring and their tangible negative consequences (potentially losing a job opportunity). Caitlin's desperate plea ("How do I stop?") underscores her recognition of the problem and her urgent need for strategies to establish autonomy. This highlights the critical importance of boundary-setting work in therapy to address this primary source of stress.

Comprehensive Narrative Summary

Caitlin Dunn presented to today's session in a state of acute emotional distress, grappling with the turbulent aftermath of two major life events occurring in rapid succession: her engagement and the loss of her job. Her primary complaints centered on overwhelming anxiety, insomnia, and a feeling of being unable to manage the flood of emotions, attributing this internal turmoil partly to her critical inner voice, termed "Bailey."

The engagement, while desired, became a significant source of anxiety due to Caitlin's intense preoccupation with societal expectations and external judgments, particularly concerning the engagement ring. Despite the ring's deep sentimental value (incorporating her late father's diamond), Caitlin found herself consumed by worries about its size and appearance relative to perceived social standards, revealing a significant vulnerability to external validation that overshadowed her personal joy.

Compounding this stress, Caitlin lost her job the day following her engagement. While expressing some relief at leaving a difficult work environment managed by a manipulative boss, the job loss triggered significant anxiety about financial insecurity, loss of health insurance, and the practicalities of unemployment. This vulnerability unfortunately activated a problematic dynamic with her mother, who responded with intrusive interference and shaming criticism regarding Caitlin's job search efforts, including contacting potential employers behind her back.

This maternal enmeshment emerged as a central theme and a primary driver of Caitlin's current distress. She described feeling badgered, controlled, and undermined by her mother's actions, leading to intense frustration and a sense of helplessness. Caitlin expressed a clear desire to establish boundaries but lacked the confidence and skills to do so effectively within this long-standing enmeshed relationship, further complicated by the absence of her late father who previously mediated this dynamic.

The confluence of engagement pressures, job loss anxieties, and maternal conflict has placed considerable strain on Caitlin's relationship with her fiancé, Kieran, necessitating shared use of Klonopin to cope with a particularly stressful breakdown related to wedding planning pressures. While the core relationship appears strong, the external stressors pose a tangible threat that requires careful navigation.

Therapeutically, the focus must be on equipping Caitlin with skills to manage her acute anxiety and emotional dysregulation, primarily through DBT-informed techniques for distress tolerance and emotion regulation. Simultaneously, intensive work on boundary setting with her mother is crucial to reduce external stress and foster autonomy. Cognitive restructuring targeting perfectionism and vulnerability to external validation is also indicated. Supporting Caitlin and Kieran in protecting their relationship from external pressures and validating the significant stress of navigating multiple major life transitions simultaneously are essential components of the treatment plan.
