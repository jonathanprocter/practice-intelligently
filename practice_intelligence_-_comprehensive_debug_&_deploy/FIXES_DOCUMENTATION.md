# Documentation of Fixes and Improvements

This document outlines the major issues identified in the codebase and the solutions implemented to resolve them.

## 1. Core Problem: Unstable & Unrunnable Application

-   **Issue**: The application could not be started reliably due to a mix of database connection failures, broken API routes, and missing setup instructions.
-   **Solution**: A holistic approach was taken to create a stable, "one-click-run" development environment.

## 2. Database Layer Overhaul

-   **Issue**: The application was hardcoded to use PostgreSQL, making local development difficult without setting up an external database. Connection logic was fragile.
-   **Solution**:
    -   **SQLite for Development**: Integrated `better-sqlite3` to provide a file-based database that requires zero configuration. The app now runs out-of-the-box.
    -   **Database Wrapper (`db-wrapper.ts`)**: Created an abstraction layer that automatically switches between SQLite (for development) and PostgreSQL (for production) based on the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. This makes the database logic clean and adaptable.
    -   **Automated Seeding (`seed-database.js`)**: A new script creates the database schema and populates it with test data (1 therapist, 3 clients) on initialization.

## 3. Server Startup and Process Management

-   **Issue**: No reliable way to start, stop, or monitor the server. Manual `node` commands were required.
-   **Solution**:
    -   **PM2 Integration**: Added `pm2` to manage the application process. This ensures the app restarts automatically on crashes and provides robust logging and monitoring.
    -   **Automated Init Script (`replit-init.sh`)**: This script is now the main entry point (`run` command in `.replit`). It handles dependency installation, database setup, and starting the server with PM2, ensuring a consistent and successful launch every time.

## 4. API Route Corrections

-   **Issue**: The document-related API routes were conflicting or incorrectly implemented, causing errors during file uploads and data retrieval.
-   **Solution**:
    -   **Fixed Document Routes (`document-routes-fix.ts`)**: Re-implemented the routes for uploading, fetching, and analyzing documents with correct logic and error handling.
    -   **Centralized Routing (`routes.ts`)**: Cleaned up the main router to correctly import and mount the fixed document routes, resolving conflicts.

## 5. AI Service Resilience

-   **Issue**: The application would crash or fail if AI provider API keys (e.g., OpenAI) were missing.
-   **Solution**:
    -   **AI Service Wrapper (`ai-service-wrapper.ts`)**: Created a wrapper that checks for the existence of API keys.
    -   **Mock Fallback**: If no API key is found, the wrapper provides a mock AI service that returns a placeholder response. This allows the application to remain fully functional for development and testing without requiring API keys.

## 6. Configuration and Environment

-   **Issue**: No clear way to manage environment variables. Important configurations were scattered.
-   **Solution**:
    -   **`.env.development`**: Added a template environment file with sensible defaults for local development.
    -   **Clearer `package.json`**: Added new scripts (`setup:dev`, `audit`) to make common tasks easier. Updated dependencies to include necessary packages like `better-sqlite3` and `bcrypt`.

## 7. System Verification

-   **Issue**: No way to quickly verify if the application was working correctly after making changes.
-   **Solution**:
    -   **System Audit Script (`comprehensive-system-audit.js`)**: A new script that runs after initialization to perform a series of checks:
        -   Verifies database connectivity and schema.
        -   Pings the `/api/health` endpoint to ensure the server is running.
        -   Tests a key API endpoint to confirm it returns data correctly.
    -   This provides immediate feedback that the core systems are operational.
