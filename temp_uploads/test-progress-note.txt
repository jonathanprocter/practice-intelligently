Comprehensive Clinical Progress Note for Jane Smith's Therapy Session on September 10, 2025

Session Date: September 10, 2025

Subjective:
Jane Smith attended today's session expressing concerns about recent anxiety related to work stress. She reported "feeling overwhelmed with the new project deadlines" and mentioned difficulty sleeping for the past two weeks. Jane stated that she has been using the breathing exercises we practiced, but finds them less effective when her anxiety peaks. She expressed motivation to continue working on coping strategies and appreciated the progress she has made so far.

Objective:
Jane presented as casually dressed but well-groomed. She maintained good eye contact throughout the session and was engaged in the therapeutic process. Her speech was clear and coherent, with a slightly accelerated rate when discussing work stressors. Affect was anxious but appropriate to content. No signs of psychomotor agitation or retardation were observed. Thought processes were logical and goal-directed.

Assessment:
Jane continues to demonstrate symptoms consistent with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (300.02), with work-related stressors serving as primary triggers. She shows good insight into her condition and remains motivated for treatment. The therapeutic alliance remains strong. Progress is being made in developing coping skills, though application during high-stress moments remains challenging. No safety concerns identified.

Plan:
1. Continue weekly individual therapy sessions focusing on CBT techniques
2. Introduced progressive muscle relaxation as an additional coping strategy
3. Homework: Practice PMR daily before bedtime and document sleep quality
4. Explore work-life balance strategies in next session
5. Consider referral for psychiatric evaluation if symptoms persist or worsen
6. Follow up on sleep hygiene practices

Next session scheduled for September 17, 2025, at 10:00 AM.
